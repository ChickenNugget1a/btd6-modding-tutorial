Start by Extracting the zip in your Mods folder

# How to use the map editor
- go in the map_editor folder, copy the "example" folder and rename it to the name of your map
- Now go in that new folder and open info.txt, you will be able to change the name, music and difficulty (0 = beginner, 3 = expert etc)
- Add your own png file and make sure it is called "image.png"
- Now launch the game and enter your map, you can now define what the paths and areas should be

## defining paths
press F1, click around, press F1 again when you're done

## defining areas
select the area type with keys 0-3, then press F2, then click to define a polygon, then press F2 again when you're done. Make sure to only change the area type when you're not already writing an area.

## end
Once you are done defining your map, close the game. You can now remove the map editor mod if you want to. When you restart the game, your map will work.
