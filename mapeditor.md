Start by Extracting the zip in your Mods folder

# How to use the map editor
- go in the map_editor folder, copy the "example" folder and rename it to the name of your map
- Now go in that new folder and open info.txt, you will be able to change the name, music and difficulty (0 = beginner, 3 = expert etc)
- Add your own png file and make sure it is called "image.png"
- Now launch the game and enter your map, you can now define what the paths and areas should be

## defining paths
press F1, click around, press F1 again when you're done

## defining areas
select the area type with keys 0-3, then press F2, then click to define a polygon, then press F2 again when you're done. It is highly recommended to start by making the entire map a "land" area and then drawing the water/walls on top of that. Polygons autocomplete themselves and the newest areas are stacked on top of the older ones.

## undoing changes
in the map's folder you can edit or delete the paths.txt or areas.txt files to undo your recent changes or to start from scratch.

## end
Once you are done defining your map, close the game. You can now remove the map editor mod if you want to. When you restart the game, your map will work.

# How to use the map loader
If someone sent you a zip file with a map in it, just extract it into the map_editor folder
